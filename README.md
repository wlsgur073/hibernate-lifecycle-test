## Project Overview
This project is a **Spring Boot** application that utilizes **Spring Data JPA** and **Hibernate 6** for database interactions. The setup allows flexible testing with both **JPA** and **Hibernate**, giving the ability to switch between the two as needed. The project is currently using **Java 17** as the language version.

## Features
- **Spring Boot 3.3.4**: Provides the core framework to quickly set up the application.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Makes it easy to work with databases by using JPA, which is implemented by Hibernate in this project. You can easily test the application with either JPA or Hibernate.
- **H2 Database**: An in-memory database used for testing purposes.
- **Lombok**: Simplifies Java code by automating repetitive boilerplate code like getters, setters, constructors, etc.
- **JUnit**: For writing and running tests using **JUnit 5**.

## Requirements
- **Java 17**
- **Maven/Gradle** (Gradle is used in this project)
- **Spring Boot**
